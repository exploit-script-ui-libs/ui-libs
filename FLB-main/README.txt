Hey, thanks for downloading FLB Pro! I really appreciate it. If you don't mind, can you start the GitHub repo. Thanks!

How to use:

Step 1: Go to https://python.org/downloads/ and download the latest version.
Step 2: Run the python Installer and MAKE SURE "INSTALL TO PATH" is checked.
Step 3: Open "FLB Pro - Installer.exe" and wait for it to finish.
Step 4: Go into the "res" folder and edit the "email" and "password" options in "config.json".
Step 5: Open "FLB Pro.exe" and then add your bot on fortnite!

NOTE: FLB Pro is in the alpha stage, errors are to be expected! Create an issue request on the github repo for support!
