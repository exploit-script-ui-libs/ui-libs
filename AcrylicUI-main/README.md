# AcrylicUI
AcrylicUI is an Open Source Control and Docking Framework for .NET Core WinForms on Windows 11

This framework was inspired by [DarkUI](https://github.com/RobinPerris/DarkUI) by Robin Perris. However DarkUI does not support High Resolution Monitors or .NET Core. 

AcrylicUI is taking the best bits of DarkUI and Supporting the latest and greatet dotnet core, Windows 11 Features like Snap Layout, Rounded Corners, Drop Shadows on Borderless Forms and Scaling for High Resolution High Dpi Monitors, and of course beautiful Windows 11 Acrylic UI panels.
 
Features of AcrylicUI:

    * Most Components migrated from DarkUI are now working (Some require High Dpi Refactoring)
    * New Dark Theme Style a blend between Windows 11 Dark Theme and MacOs Dark Theme
    * Support for Acyrlic and Glass WindowPanels
    * Support for High Resolution Monitors
    * Support for Custom TitleBars and Borderless WindowPanels
    * Support for Borderless Windows Snapping
    * Support for Borderless Windows 11 Snap Layout Popups (Hack)
    * Support for .NET Core (No depenedency on .Net Full Framwork)

This is clearly a Work In Progress and should not be considered production ready.

There is a clear path of the work to be done to migrate all relevant Controls from DarkUI to AcrylicUI. 

My Focus is supporting my own projects and I migrate Controls based on my personal priority.
