# How to

"How do I create Mechlife soundpacks?" Well, its really easy! All you have to do is right click on the system tray icon, select the editor. Then you will see a new window pop up. If you only have one soundfile that you specify the time of the click. Or if you have multiple files, or one for each key you may select that option. Now, you fill in all of the keys with the specified time or sound file that will be used when that key is clicked. Then you can click the export button and you will be given a config.json file. Make sure to put the config.json in the folder where your sound file(s) are.

# Thanks

I just want to thank all of the people that have created submissions and soundpacks. It truly means the world to me as I have added that feature for people that know what the're doing, but I have seen that almost every user has been creating or using custom soundpacks. If you have created a sound pack. I would love it if you could please email them to [me](mailto:paysonholmes@gmail.com) so I can post them here for the community.
