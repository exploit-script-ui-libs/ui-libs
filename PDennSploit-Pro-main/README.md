<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## Project Info.

PDennSploit is the #1 Free Roblox Exploit. PDennSploit Pro, is ten times better. With a cutting edge design and features like no other, PDennSploit is the way to go. In this documentation I will go over the features and design while comparing to other popular paid exploits.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Design

The design chosen for PDennSploit Pro was based off the Script-Ware UI because of it's tab system and great organization. It contains a modern and compact feeling using a custom version of Monaco and Monaco tabs especially for PDennSploit Pro. It also has different tabs that link to different forms such as Home, Script Hub, Options, and a Console!
